                <aside>
                    <h4><strong>Tank Cleaning, Salinity Levels, and Proper Temperature</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The most important thing about how to properly clean a tank is to ensure the fish are still in the tank. I cannot over-emphasize this enough. Failure to do this may cause rejection of the tank by the fish upon reintroduction, so keeping them in the environment during cleaning is key to avoid domicile rejection. </li><br>
                        <li>Second, add one tablespoon of pink salt every day to the fish tank to maintain the appropriate level of salinity. This should be a sufficient amount. If you find your fish are experiencing low blood pressure, you may need to adjust the amount to be slightly higher. Similarly, if their blood pressure is too high, reduce the amount of salt slightly. </li><br>
                        <li>When it comes to the appropriate temperature, we recommend either the range of 25-29 degrees Farenheit or 98-115 degrees Farenheit, depending on whether you harvested the specimen from north or south of the Equator, respectively.</li><br>
                        <li>An additional tip regarding cleaning, do not clean the tanks too often. Again, this can lead to domicile rejection syndrome. It is recommmended to clean the tank no more than once every five years.</li><br>
                        <li>For fish that die, you may have read that they should be promptly removed from the tank. This is a misnomer. You should, instead, leave fish that are deceased in the tank. This helps the tank ecosystem in two ways: first, it gives the other fish mourning time with their tankmate; second, after the mouring period, the 'Alpha Phish' can begin eating the recently deceased as a show of their dominance.</li><br>
